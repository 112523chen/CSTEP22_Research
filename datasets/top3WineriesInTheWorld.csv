126576,US,"Rich and round, this offers plenty of concentrated blackberry notes enveloped in warm spices and supple oak. There's a hint of green tomato leaves throughout, but the lush fruit combined with sturdy grape tannins and high acidity would pair well with fatty short ribs or braised pork.",Estate Club,1900-03-27 0:00:00,32,Virginia,Virginia,,Merlot,Veramar
127077,Italy,"This luminous sparkler offers measured aromas of yellow fruit and honey and delivers a broad, wide approach in the mouth.

143029,US,"There are some pretty features to this wine, namely the lovely tannins and rich fruit, but it's just too soft and sweet. Tastes like blackberry jam, with extra white sugar spinkled on top.",Signature,1900-03-23 0:00:00,45,California,Paso Robles,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon,Byington
98813,US,"Lovely nose, which runs from violets and cherries right into coffee and sweet chocolate. In the mouth the wine coats the palate with Napa-like intensity, only buttressed with more vivid acidity. It's both smooth and deep. The aromas are more detailed, interesting and really clean, loaded with dark flavors of soy, coffee, molasses and black cherry liqueur.",Champoux & Loess Vineyards Reserve,1900-04-02 0:00:00,100,Washington,Washington,Washington Other,Cabernet Sauvignon,Boudreaux Cellars
43172,US,"Tastes sweeter and fruitier than the 2009, which was dry, so if you like orange marmalade, pineapple tart and vanilla cookie sugariness in your Sauvignon Blancs, it's for you.",Les Pionniers,1900-03-26 0:00:00,40,California,Sonoma County,Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc,Capture
